# dsrg
Collection of codes used to implement and test approaches based on the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG).
We provide both spinorbital and spin-integrated implementations of multireference (MR) DSRG methods aimed at capturing 
dynamical correlation effects missing from complete-active-space (CAS) wave functions of the configuration interaction 
(CI) or self-consistent field (SCF) types. 

The DSRG codes provided in this repository are based on the spinorbital implementations found in https://github.com/brianz98/4c-DSRG-MRPT.
